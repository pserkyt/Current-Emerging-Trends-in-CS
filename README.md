# Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science
CS-370 Southern New Hampshire University

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was given all of the code except for the Q-Training Algorithm code block inside the Jupyter notebook file, which I had to write myself. This project was challenging for me due to the fact that the best computer I own is a 2012 Macbook Pro. Although the Intel i7 CPU is powerful, training the model on CPU power is at minimum 10x slower than using a GPU. Tensorflow currently only supports NVIDIA's CUDA for GPU acceleration. Unfortunately, the GPU in my old Macbook Pro is not supported by CUDA or Tensorflow. I was instead able to run the Jupyter notebook using Microsoft's Azure AI platform with my student account, configured with a GPU. In the end, I was able to borrow a 2021 Macbook Air with Apple M1 chip to leverage Apple's tensorflow-metal PluggableDevice in TensorFlow v2.5 to complete the project.
